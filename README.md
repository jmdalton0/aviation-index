# Aviation Index 
## A Comprehensive Study Tool For Pilots

Aviation Index is a full‑stack, web‑based study platform created for pilots who need a fast, structured way to master aviation knowledge. The project aimed to turn a sprawling collection of scattered notes and flashcards into a simple, organized, and concise application. The application organizes aviation information into Topics and Questions and tracks each user’s progress as they study the material. From a user’s perspective, it feels like an adaptive question bank.

The application is built using the Spring Boot framework with session-based authentication. Data is persisted using a MySQL database. Client web pages are generated using the Thymleaf Templating engine. Key features include secure password management with BCrypt, a user-friendly library of aviation-specific information, enum‑driven study‑status tracking, and tailored filters for managing session content.

The entire software development process included phases for design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Design plans included user stories, a complete requirements list, a comprehensive data dictionary, a low-level architecture design, and detailed implementation and testing plans. Implementation was carried out according to the design plans and guided by the requirements list with testability in mind. To track project success, a traceability matrix was used to map requirements to final project artifacts and tests.
